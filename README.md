Binary vs ASCII testing

## Details
This is a small C++ code that writes two files and ASCII file and 
a binary file. They are full of n floats. The executable times 
the write process for each one and compares the size of the written 
files. The read.py script is a script that reads the files to ensure
useful data can be obtained from the binary file after it has been
written

This was a small repo that was used to test the feasibility of ASCII
or binary output for larger simulations.
